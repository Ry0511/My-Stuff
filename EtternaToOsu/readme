### Code Notes
I don't particularly like this implementation for the conversion. There are a
lot of oversights that could have been predicted/seen but I kinda got burnt out
writing the code and just wanted it done so I can start on something else.

I may at some point come back to this and properly implement it but right now
all it needs to do is what it is doing.

## Info
The conversion config is dynamic, in that, fields are auto loaded from the
command line, though a very hacky solution was taken just to get a simple
implementation.
